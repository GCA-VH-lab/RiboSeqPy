# \\  1 - Download the data
# \\  2 - Perform adapter trimming on downloaded FASTQ files
# \\  3 - Perform quality filtering on trimmed FASTQ files
# \\  4 - Remove sequences that align to non-coding RNAs from the filtered FASTQ files
# \\  5 - Align sequences to the genome from the ncRNA subtracted FASTQ files
# \\  6 - Create Raw Assignment from the genome aligned sorted/indexed BAM file
# \\  7 - Create Metagenomic tables
# \\  8 - Create Metagenomic plots
# \\  ------------ Pipeline Part 1 end   -----------------
# \\  ------------ Pipeline Part 2 start -----------------
# \\  9 - Corrected assignment
# \\ 10 - Metagenomic tables from corrected assignment
# \\ 11 - Codon Tables for conditions A & B
# \\ 12 - Master Tables for all replicas
#
# Clean: bgzip
#
# \\ bgzip - Gzip files after they are no longer necessary using multiple threads - 6 is hard coded
# \\ gzip  - Gzip files after they are no longer necessary
# \\ rm    - Remove files after they are no longer necessary
#
# Quality: 0.80
#
# \\ Quality filter threshold for retaining reads (0.0 - 1.0). Higher is more selective.
#
# Mapping: 5
#
# \\ 5 - Map reads according to their 5' end
# \\ 3 - Map reads according to their 3' end  todo testing
#
# ReadLenMiN: 25
# ReadLenMaX: 35
#
# \\ 20 - ReadLenMiN length of reads included -! going to replace Length
# \\ 34 - ReadLenMaX length of reads included -! going to replace Length
#
# Normalised: rpm
#
# \\ rpm - use normalized data - reads per miljon
# \\ raw - raw counts
#
# MappedTwice: Yes
#
#  \\ No or Yes IF Yes include reads mapped once and twice
#
# MetagThreshold: 30
#
# \\ 30 - number of 5/3' mappings (raw counts) found around start or stop if less ignore a gene/region
# \\ If Normalized = "rpm"  MetagThreshold is readjusted accordingly - divided by normalization_factor
#
# MetagSpan: 60
#
# \\ 60 - number of nucleotides before and after start/stop in metagene profiles
#
# MetagSpancorr: 300
#
# \\ 90 - number of nucleotides before and after start/stop in metagenomic profile from corrected data
#
# GeneRpmMeanThr: 0.005
#
# \\ is overwritten by hard coded formula   GeneRpmMeanThr = 0.3 / norm_factor  # FILTER 1  - low threshold
#
# GeneRpmMeanThr2: 0.005
#
# \\ Threshold for RNAseq  normalised RiboSeq  (rpm/rpm)  # FILTER 6  - low threshold
#
# CodonRpmMeanThr: 0.1
#
# \\ is overwritten by hard coded formula   CodonRpmMeanThr = 1.6 / norm_factor  # FILTER 2  - more restrictive
#
# OffsetFile: readlength_offsets_expert.txt
#
# \\ file with read length and offsets - only these readlength are included into corrected/final assignment
#
# cpu: 6
#
# \\ number of cores - have effect for some steps
#
#
# \\ Groups
# \\ Group refers to samples of different replicas but same conditions
# \\ Replica is defined as order of sample names under Group
# \\ An Example. GroupA  S1;S2   GroupB S3;S4
# \\              Replica 1 -  S1, S3
# \\              Replica 2 -  S2, S4
# \\ Sample names in groups must be same as they are in  SRR2046309	wtS1
#
# GroupA: MetS2;MetS4
#
# \\ Names of semicolon ";" separated samples incubated under specific conditions TREATED
# \\ S1;S2
#
#
# GroupB: WTS1;WTS3
#
# \\ Names of semicolon ";" separated samples used as CONTROL
# \\ S3;S4
#
# \\ affects sequence part of codon tables and Master table
#
# CodonsBeforePSite: 1
#
# \\ 1 - A-site included (default)
# \\ 2 - A-site + one codon before
#
# \\ SRR0000001,2,3,4 are fake SRRs. You can use
#SRR0000001	WTS1_20m
