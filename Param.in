# \\ Quality filter threshold for retaining reads (0.0 - 1.0). Higher is more selective.

# MetagThreshold: 60
#
# \\ 30 - number of 5/3' mappings (raw counts) found around start or stop if less ignore a gene/region
# \\ If Normalized = "rpm"  MetagThreshold is readjusted accordingly inside program - divided by normalization_factor

# Normalised: rpm
#
# \\ rpm - use normalized data - reads per miljon (cpm)
# \\ raw - raw counts
