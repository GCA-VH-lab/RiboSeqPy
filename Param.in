# Start: 2

# 
# \\  0 - Read parameters and do nothing
# \\  1 - Download the data
# \\  2 - Perform adapter trimming on downloaded FASTQ files
# \\  3 - Perform quality filtering on trimmed FASTQ files
# \\  4 - Remove sequences that align to non-coding RNAs from the filtered FASTQ files
# \\  5 - Align sequences to the genome from the ncRNA subtracted FASTQ files
# \\  6 - Create Raw Assignment from the genome aligned sorted/indexed BAM file
# \\  7 - Create Metagenomic tables
# \\  8 - Create Metagenomic plots 
# \\  9 - Corrected assignment
#
# Clean: rm
# 
# \\ gzip  - Gzip files after they are no longer necessary
# \\ rm    - Remove files after they are no longer necessary
#
# Quality: 0.90
#
# \\ Quality filter threshold for retaining reads (0.0 - 1.0). Higher is more selective.
#
# Mapping: 5
#
# \\ 5 - Map reads according to their 5' end
# \\ 3 - Map reads according to their 3' end
#
# ReadLenMiN: 25
# ReadLenMaX: 34
#
# \\ 26 - ReadLenMiN length of reads included -! going to replace Length 
# \\ 33 - ReadLenMaX length of reads included -! going to replace Length
#
# MetagThreshold: 60
#
# \\ 30 - number of 5/3' mappings found around start or stop if less ignore a gene/region
#
# MetagSpan: 60
#
# \\ 60 - number of nucleotides before and after start/stop in metagenomic profile 
#
# Normalised: raw
#
# \\ rpm - use normalized data - reads per miljon (cpm)
# \\ raw - raw counts
